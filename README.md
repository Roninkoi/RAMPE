# RAKIAC - Relay-Architectured Keeper of Information And Calculator

The RAKIAC is a relay computer with a simple ISA that I designed. 
The purpose of this project is to explore early computing and CPU design.

I wrote the code and documentation for myself, so beware inconsistencies.

Included are the RASM assembler and RSIM simulator. Both are written in Fortran.
