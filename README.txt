# RAKIAC

The RAKIAC is a fictional relay computer with a toy ISA that I designed. 
The purpose of this project is to explore early computing and CPU design.

I wrote the code and documentation for myself, so beware inconsistencies.

Included are the RASM assembler and RSIM simulator. Both are written in Fortran.
